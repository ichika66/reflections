How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff help you understand which sentence is add/remove from the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily go back to the earlier version of a file to fix bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It doesn't create too many commit but if you are not cautious, commit might not be enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is aimed for programming but Google Docs are mainly for document files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to see the history of a file and each comment, then use git diff to compare these files by using commit id you can find on the result of git log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is easy to go back earler version of a file to fix bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I use git for my Udacy Nanodegree projects.
