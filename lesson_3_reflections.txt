When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work from where I cannot access to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I don't want Git to push my work automatically to GitHub because I might have something I don't want to show in public yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are like clones and it create a copy of source file but only on GitHub.
  I rather use fork when I would like to refer and modify other people's work on GitHub. 
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  To see the updated status of a work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I can collaborate using file server system or email. It would be easier to save or send a file to collaboraters but there are lot of danger to degrate a work.
  Also, it is not easy to manually see the different between multiple files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  Making chnages in a seperate branch is suitable when you and want to experiment new feature of a work without breaking master branch. It has benefit for assuring always master is working properly.
