When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work from where I cannot access to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I don't want Git to push my work automatically to GitHub because I might have something I don't want to show in public yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are like clones and it create a copy of source file but only on GitHub.
  I rather use fork when I would like to refer and modify other people's work on GitHub. 
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  To see the updated status of a work.
