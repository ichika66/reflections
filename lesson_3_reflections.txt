When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work from where I cannot access to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I don't want Git to push my work automatically to GitHub because I might have something I don't want to show in public yet.
